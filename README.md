# Mimic
Desktop robotic arm toy

Box with two arms, each with 4 degrees of freedom: Waist, Elbow, Wrist, and Pincher.
The first arm has a 5K or 10K potentiometer at each joint and the other arm has a servo at each joint.
The first arm is the input arm, reading the 4 analog values from the pots
The second arm is the output arm that can mimic the movements of the input arm
A pushbutton and a bi-color LED are provided as input and output for setup, mode selection etc.

Current features:

  + can "park" the output arm so it lays flat across to box top
  + Movements can be recorded and played back
